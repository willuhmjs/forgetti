The Moonraker integration allows Forgetti to interact with your 3D printer through the Moonraker API.

## Configuration
The configuration of the Moonraker integration is done in the <i>Moonraker</i> widget of the configuration menu.

### Moonraker URL
* This is the URL of your Moonraker instance.
* Ensure that the URL is accessible from the device running Forgetti.

### Pause Threshold
* This is the confidence threshold at which Forgetti will pause the print.
* For example, a pause threshold of 70% means Forgetti will pause the print if it detects a failure with 70% confidence or higher.
