The dashboard is how you interface with Forgetti and includes a variety of widgets to help you interact with the software. The dashboard is divided into three pages: Home, Configuration, and Logs. Each page has widgets that allow you to interact with the software and view information.

## Home

The Home page gives you a glance into the status of your Forgetti instance. It shows you what Forgetti sees and how your system is doing.

## Configuration

The Configuration page is where you will do most of your setup because this is where you change how your instance operates.

## Logs

The Logs page provides information from the server during app updates. It helps you know whether the requested update has succeeded or failed.
